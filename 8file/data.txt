The morning after Election Day smacked Democrats with a combination of shock and sadness. 
Donald Trump would be the next US President. For thousands, disappointment turned to protest as Hillary Clinton supporters channeled their disbelief into a single defiant message.
"Not my President," they chanted. "Not today." In response to Trump's victory, a shocking win fueled by the rural roar of a dismayed white America, tens of thousands in at least 25 US cities -- including New York and Nashville, Chicago and Cleveland, San Francisco and Seattle -- shouted anti-Trump slogans, started fires, and held candlelight vigils to mourn the result.
